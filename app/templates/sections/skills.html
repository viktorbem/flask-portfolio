    <h1 class="main__title">My Skills</h1>
    <p class="main__text">Through my life I had learned many programming languages. I started with Basic on my first computer
        Commodore C64, later I used Pascal on my PC and C through my studies on University. But there are some
        tools I keep using over and over again, and that are HTML and CSS. Therefore I realized that web
        development is my path of choice.</p>
